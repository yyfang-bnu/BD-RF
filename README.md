Soil Bulk Density Using Random Forest

This repository contains R code for implementing the Random Forest algorithm, aimed at predicting the spatial distribution of soil bulk density at landscape scale based on altitude, vegetation, and soil factors. The Random Forest algorithm is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

Prerequisites To run the code in this repository, you need:
• R-studio (2023 or higher)
